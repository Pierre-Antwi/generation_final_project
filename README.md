# generation_final_project

Description:
A final group project for the Junior Web Developer program of Skillgrowth(formally known as Generation USA), where we were tasked with creating a task manager from scratch. For the task manager, we used html, css, bootstrap, and javascript to make a functional application to add tasks, mark the tasks as complete, and then delete the tasks.
